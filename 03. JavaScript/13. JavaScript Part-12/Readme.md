# JavaScript Part 12 ðŸš€

Welcome to Part 12 of my "FrontEnd Web Dev" series! ðŸŒŸ

In this part, I've expanded my knowledge in the following areas:

1. Learned about Async and Await, and how to handle rejections effectively.
2. Delved into the concept of APIs, and successfully accessed various APIs.
3. Explored JSON, and how to access and manipulate JSON data.
4. Mastered API testing, delving into Ajax, HTTP verbs, and understanding status codes.
5. Added information to URLs, and managed HTTPS headers for secure communication.
6. Created my first API request, and harnessed the power of `fetch` with async/await.

I've acquired a deeper understanding of asynchronous operations, API interactions, and the nuances of data retrieval and manipulation.

Your feedback is appreciated! ðŸŽŠðŸ˜Š
